## PhD birds in silvopastoral landscapes ##
## Data wrangling 08 -- Final wrangling to filter 'Bird_pcs_dist.csv' to generate 'Bird_pcs_analysis.csv', which is the subset of observations within the fixed point count radius (50m) and that used the habitat (e.g. excluding flyovers)

## Description: These are the steps we took to prepare the analysis file for our purposes; however, these are only suggestions and should be modified according to the needs of your analysis

# Load libraries & data ---------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)

# guess_max = Inf: Recording is sparse (only ~180 non-NA, near the end) so the default type guess misreads it as logical and drops the values
# any_of rename: Anglicise if 04 hasn't yet rewritten this file with English headers (2026 rename)
Bird_pcs_dist <- read_csv(file = "Derived/Excels/Bird_pcs/Bird_pcs_dist.csv", guess_max = Inf) %>%
  rename(any_of(c(Id_survey = "Id_muestreo", Id_survey_no_dc = "Id_muestreo_no_dc", Date = "Fecha",

# General formatting ---------------------------------------------------------
# Format point count data for downstream analyses

# Remove recordings ---------------------------------------------------------
# Given the inconsistent effort, remove birds that were only identified in recording
Bird_pcs_analysis2 <- Bird_pcs_analysis1 %>% 
  filter(is.na(Recording) | Recording == "Cf")

# Remove flyovers ---------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: CIPAV did not record information on flyovers (sobrevuelos). Thus we cannot exclude the possibility that a species flew over the observer and was included in the data set, despite NOT using the habitat. 
Bird_pcs_analysis3 <- Bird_pcs_analysis2 %>%

# Remove distances > 50m --------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:: there are a few rows that have NAs for distance as data collector forgot to enter a distance in the field 
Bird_pcs_analysis3 %>% 
  filter(is.na(Distance_bird)) 

# However, there are a few species (e.g. hummingbirds, manakins) that would be nearly impossible to identify at >50m. Change the distance of these species to <50m so that they are maintained
